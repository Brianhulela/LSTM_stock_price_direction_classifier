# Stock Price Prediction with LSTM

This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict stock price movements based on historical weekly data from 19 companies. The model is trained to predict whether the stock price will go up or down in the following week using binary classification.

The repository includes all the code for data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and result visualization.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the model.
